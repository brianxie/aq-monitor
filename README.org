#+TITLE: aq-monitor

*Update: PurpleAir is now using a [[https://api.purpleair.com/][new API]], and has bricked the old API which this app was using.*

Monitors air quality using [[https://www2.purpleair.com/community/faq#!hc-access-the-json][PurpleAir sensor data]]. This tool uses (will use) the same [[https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/custom-js/conc-aqi.js][AQI formula]] as the [[https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-calculator-concentration/][AirNow.gov calculator]].
